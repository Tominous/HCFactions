# Debug
# Turn this on if you are having issues with something and working on resolving them.
# This will spam your console with information that is useful if you know how to read the source.
# It's suggested that you only turn this on at the direction of a developer.

# Prevent find factions exploit
# This will help limit how many times a player can be sent a map of factions.
# Set this to the cooldown you want, in miliseconds, for a map to be shown to a player.
# If you want to log when a player violates this (only happens on chunk enter so it shouldn't be too spammy),
#   set log to true and it will be logged to console as "player tried to show a faction map too soon and triggered exploit blocker."

# Default Relation allows you to change the default relation for Factions.
# Example usage would be so people can't leave then make a new Faction while Raiding
#   in order to be able to execute commands if the default relation is neutral.
# This has always been neutral.

# Portal Creation
# Do you want to limit portal creation?
portals:
  limit: false # will disable the below check if set to false

  # What should the minimum relation be to create a portal in territory?
  # Goes in the order of: ENEMY, NEUTRAL, ALLY, MEMBER.
  # Minimum relation allows that and all listed to the right to create portals.
  # Example: put ALLY to allow ALLY and MEMBER to be able to create portals.
  minimum-relation: MEMBER # If typed incorrectly, defaults to NEUTRAL.

# Warps
# What should be the max amount of warps that a Factoin can set?
max-warps: 5

# This is the cost section for warps.
# It will charge them each time the command would be successful. (won't charge on erroneous /f warp attempts).

# Pistons
